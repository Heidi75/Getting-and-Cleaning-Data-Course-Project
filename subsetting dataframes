subsetting
single brackets [ ] for matrix
double brackets and $ for list elements

A dataframe is a list of all vectors of the same length 

this will selects elements in the list  - all results is a vector
dataframe$columnname =
dataframe[["columnname"]] =
dataframe[[columnnumber]]

new lists with only the elements makes a new dataframe
with single brackets
dataframe["columnname"] =
dataframe[columnnumber]

Adding columns ( This is important when adding the activities )
columnvector<-c(a,b,c,d, )
dataframe$columnvectorname<-columnvector =
dataframe[["columnvectorname"]]

Adding columns with cbind ( Must look at which columns add up we can see besides feature x and y the others are all single vector columns, 
train vectors match with training data and test vectors match with testing data)
Add rows with rbind  (x and y feature dataset should have the matching rowns but the test is the shorter data set and train is the larger one
as they have the same amount of columns one should go on top of the other and they should match up )


#put the test data on top of the training data and bind with row bind
featuredatabase<-rbind(feature_test_x,feature_train_x)
activity_vector<-rbind(activity_test_y,activity_train_y)
subject_vector<-rbind(subject_test,subject_train)

#then we can combine the column which we think that the subect
#subject and activity vector
subject_activity_df<-cbind(subject_vector,activity_vector)
total_dataset<-cbind(subject_activity_df,featuredatabase)
